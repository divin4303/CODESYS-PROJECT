  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This project demonstrates an industrial automation system using CODESYS PLC programming on a Raspberry Pi 4, 
    integrated with Factory I/O for process simulation and Node-RED for monitoring and visualization. 
    The system controls a conveyor belt that assembles a base and a lid emitted randomly from an emitter,
    using a two-axis pick and place unit to position the lid on the base. 
    Motion is controlled through interactive switches within the Factory I/O environment and a Node-RED HMI connected via OPC UA, 
    while all system actions and assembly counts are stored in a MySQL database. 
    The practical part of the project is implemented using the Raspberry Pi 4 and an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor for distance detection. 
    since this is a hobby project focused on understanding functionality rather than a scaled-up industrial application, the HC-SR04 is used even though it is not a SIL-rated device.

  <h2>System Architecture</h2>
  <p>
    The control logic is developed using Function Block Diagram (FBD) and Structured Text within the CODESYS environment. 
    Modbus TCP is used to enable communication between the PLC logic and the Factory I/O simulation. 
    Unlike high-speed industrial standards like PROFINET, this setup relies on standard TCP, which is 
    sufficient for learning but can introduce network lag if large files are being handled simultaneously. 
    This configuration enables a clear study of how data flows among the controller, the simulation, and the Node-RED-based monitoring tools.

  <h2>Node-RED HMI and Visualization</h2>
  <p>
    The Node-RED dashboard operates as an OPC UA client, enabling real-time monitoring and control of PLC variables. 
    It provides Start/Stop control and displays the total counted parts directly from the system. Users can switch between Manual and Automatic (Betrieb) modes via the PLC registers. 
    While the dashboard includes features for Live analog monitoring with setpoint adjustment and High-speed time-series data visualization, these are currently in the development stage and not yet active.

  <p>
  As an extension to the system, the project aims to integrate an SQL-based historian (either MySQL or SQLite).
  This implementation will transition the system from real-time visualization to long-term data logging, 
  specifically targeting the archival of parts counters and assembly success rates.
